  "agent_response": "Bonds can be categorized in several ways, primarily based on the issuer, credit quality, and maturity. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**1. By Issuer:**\n\n*   **Government Bonds:** Issued by national governments to finance spending. These are often considered lower risk, especially those from developed nations (Source 1).\n*   **Municipal Bonds:** Issued by state, city, or local governments to fund public projects. These can be tax-exempt, making them attractive to investors (Source 2).\n*   **Corporate Bonds:** Issued by companies to raise capital for various purposes, such as expansion or acquisitions. Corporate bonds generally carry a higher risk than government bonds (Source 2).\n\n**2. By Credit Quality:**\n\n*   **Investment-Grade Bonds:** These bonds are considered relatively low risk and are rated BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's or Baa3 or higher by Moody's (Source 3).\n*   **High-Yield Bonds (Junk Bonds):** These bonds have a lower credit rating (BB+ or lower by S&P, or Ba1 or lower by Moody's) and are considered riskier. To compensate for the higher risk, they offer higher yields (Source 3).\n\n**3. By Maturity:**\n\n*   **Short-Term Bonds:** Mature in one to five years (Source 3).\n*   **Intermediate-Term Bonds:** Mature in five to ten years (Source 3).\n*   **Long-Term Bonds:** Mature in over ten years (Source 3).\n\n**4. Other Types of Bonds:**\n\n*   **Convertible Bonds:** These bonds can be converted into a predetermined amount of the issuer's equity or common stock (Source 3).\n*   **Zero-Coupon Bonds:** These bonds don't pay periodic interest (coupons). Instead, they are sold at a discount to their face value and mature at face value (Source 1). The investor's return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value.\n*   **Inflation-Indexed Bonds:** These bonds are designed to protect investors from inflation. The principal amount is adjusted based on an inflation index (Source 1).",
