  "agent_response": "Apple's current stock price is $273.81, with a day high of $275.43 and a day low of $272.20.\n\nNews items include:\n*   Nike's stock jumped after Tim Cook increased his stake.\n*   The Italian Competition Authority fined Apple EUR 98M over app tracking, which Apple is appealing.\n*   A judge blocked an app store age verification law in Texas.\n*   An article discusses an AI stock potentially becoming the \"Apple of the 2030s\".\n\nThe news seems mixed. The fine from the Italian Competition Authority and the blocked Texas law could be seen as negative, while the article about an \"Apple of the 2030s\" and Tim Cook's increased stake in Nike might be seen as positive, although the latter is only indirectly related to Apple. It's difficult to say definitively how the news is affecting the stock price, but the intraday movement has been relatively contained.",
