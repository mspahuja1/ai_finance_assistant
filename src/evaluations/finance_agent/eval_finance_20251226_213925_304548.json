  "agent_response": "A financial advisor is a professional who helps you manage your money and achieve your financial goals. They provide guidance and advice on a range of financial matters, such as investments, retirement planning, insurance, and estate planning.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of what a financial advisor does:\n\n*   **Financial Planning:** They work with you to create a comprehensive financial plan that outlines your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. This plan serves as a roadmap for your financial future (Source 1).\n*   **Investment Management:** Financial advisors can help you choose appropriate investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, based on your individual circumstances. They may also manage your investment portfolio on your behalf (Source 1).\n*   **Retirement Planning:** They assist you in planning for retirement by estimating your future expenses, determining how much you need to save, and developing a strategy for generating income in retirement. This often includes advice on 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement accounts (Source 1).\n*   **Insurance Planning:** Financial advisors can assess your insurance needs and recommend appropriate coverage, such as life insurance, health insurance, and disability insurance (Source 1).\n*   **Estate Planning:** They can help you with estate planning matters, such as creating a will or trust, to ensure that your assets are distributed according to your wishes (Source 1).\n*   **Tax Planning:** They can offer advice on tax-efficient investment strategies and help you minimize your tax liability (Source 1).\n\nKeep in mind that I am a Financial Education Agent and not a financial advisor. You should consult a licensed financial professional for financial advice.",
