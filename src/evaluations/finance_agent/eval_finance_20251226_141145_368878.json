  "agent_response": "Simple interest and compound interest are two different ways of calculating interest on a principal amount. Here's a breakdown of each:\n\n**Simple Interest:**\n\n*   Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount.\n*   The interest earned in each period is not added back to the principal. So, you earn the same amount of interest every period.\n\n**Compound Interest:**\n\n*   Compound interest is calculated on the principal amount and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. (Source 1)\n*   Essentially, you're earning \"interest on interest.\" The interest earned is added to the principal, and the next interest calculation is based on this new, higher amount. (Source 2)\n\n**Key Differences Summarized:**\n\n| Feature          | Simple Interest                                  | Compound Interest                                                                  |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Calculation      | On the original principal only                   | On the original principal and accumulated interest                                  |\n| Interest on Interest | No                                               | Yes                                                                                |\n| Growth             | Linear                                           | Exponential (Source 2)                                                              |\n| Earnings           | Lower returns compared to compound interest     | Higher returns compared to simple interest, especially over longer periods (Source 2) |\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you deposit $1,000 into an account with a 5% annual interest rate.\n\n*   **Simple Interest:** You'd earn $50 in interest each year ($1,000 x 0.05). After 5 years, you'd have earned a total of $250 in interest.\n*   **Compound Interest:** In the first year, you'd also earn $50. However, in the second year, you'd earn interest on $1,050 (the original $1,000 plus the $50 interest). This means you'd earn slightly more than $50 in the second year, and even more in subsequent years as the balance grows.\n\nAs illustrated, the frequency at which interest is compounded affects the total interest earned (Source 1). Interest can be compounded yearly, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or even daily. (Source 1)",
