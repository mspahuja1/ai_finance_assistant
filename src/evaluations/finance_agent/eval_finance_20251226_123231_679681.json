  "agent_response": "Compound interest is when interest is earned on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods (Source 1). It's like earning interest on your interest.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **How it works:** Instead of paying out the interest earned, it's reinvested or retained, which then earns more interest in the future (Source 1).\n*   **Simple vs. Compound Interest:** Compound interest is different from simple interest, where interest isn't added to the principal (Source 1).\n*   **Frequency matters:** The more frequently interest is compounded (e.g., daily vs. annually), the faster the principal grows (Source 1, 3). For instance, corporate and government bonds usually pay interest twice a year (semi-annually) (Source 2).\n*   **Exponential growth:**  Due to compounding, debt grows exponentially (Source 3).",
