Since the value of things fluctuates over time, valuations are as of a specific date like the end of the accounting quarter or year. They may alternatively be mark-to-market estimates of the current value of assets or liabilities as of this minute or this day for the purposes of managing portfolios and associated financial risk (for example, within large financial firms including investment banks and stockbrokers).\nSome balance sheet items are much easier to value than others.

The discounted rate normally includes a risk premium which is commonly based on the capital asset pricing model. \nFor discussion of the mechanics, see Valuation using discounted cash flows.\nIn July 2010, a Delaware court ruled on appropriate inputs to use in discounted cash flow analysis in a dispute between shareholders and a company over the proper fair value of the stock.

The amount of interest paid every six months is the disclosed interest rate divided by two and multiplied by the principal. The yearly compounded rate is higher than the disclosed rate.\nCanadian mortgage loans are generally compounded semi-annually with monthly or more frequent payments.\nU.S. mortgages use an amortizing loan, not compound interest. With these loans, an amortization schedule is used to determine how to apply payments toward principal and interest.  Interest generated on these loans is not added to the principal, but rather is paid off monthly as the payments are applied.",

Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e.

Academic research has consistently found that most active investors (stock pickers) within a given market segment underperform the relevant index after fees and taxes.

The movement gained popularity among millennials during the 2010s through blogs, podcasts, and discussion forums.\nFIRE adherents try to reduce expenses and increase savings, investing surplus assets to eventually cover living costs through passive income. Some FIRE writers promote a simplified framework: spend less than one earns, invest the surplus, and avoid excessive debt. A commonly-cited savings target is the 4% rule, introduced by William Bengen. The rule suggests that a retirement portfolio should equal at least 25 times estimated annual expenses to support long-term withdrawals.\n\n---\n\n[Source 3: Diversification (finance)]\n== Examples ==\nThe simplest example of diversification is provided by the proverb \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\". Dropping the basket will break all the eggs. Placing each egg in a different basket is more diversified. There is more risk of losing one egg, but less risk of losing all of them. On the other hand, having a lot of baskets may increase costs.\nIn finance, an example of an undiversified portfolio is to hold only one stock. This is risky; it is not unusual for a single stock to go down 50% in one year. It is less common for a portfolio of 20 stocks to go down that much, especially if they are selected at random. If the stocks are selected from a variety of industries, company sizes and asset types it is even less likely to experience a 50% drop since it will mitigate any trends in that industry, company class, or asset type.",
