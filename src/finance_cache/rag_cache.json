Since the value of things fluctuates over time, valuations are as of a specific date like the end of the accounting quarter or year. They may alternatively be mark-to-market estimates of the current value of assets or liabilities as of this minute or this day for the purposes of managing portfolios and associated financial risk (for example, within large financial firms including investment banks and stockbrokers).\nSome balance sheet items are much easier to value than others.

The discounted rate normally includes a risk premium which is commonly based on the capital asset pricing model. \nFor discussion of the mechanics, see Valuation using discounted cash flows.\nIn July 2010, a Delaware court ruled on appropriate inputs to use in discounted cash flow analysis in a dispute between shareholders and a company over the proper fair value of the stock.
